# 🚄 Netra - A Smart Railway Surveillance 🛤️

* In order to improve transportation infrastructure, this Repo describes a web application that uses artificial intelligence (AI) 🧠 and advanced machine learning to monitor traffic 🚦, identify potholes, and detect accidents in real time. The system intends to make travel safer and more effective by enhancing road safety 🛣️, easing traffic, and facilitating quick incident response 🚑.

<br>

## 📝 Description

* The current Indian Railway CCTV Network is inadequate for effective crowd management 👥, crime prevention 🚫, and passenger health monitoring 💓. Existing systems fail to provide real-time alerts for suspicious activities, health incidents, and overcrowding, compromising passenger safety and operational efficiency. This creates safety and operational issues.

* We propose an AI-powered web app to address this. It will use live CCTV data 🎥 and pre-trained AI models to detect crime, overcrowding, suspicious objects, and health emergencies in real-time. Authorities will receive instant alerts and have an interactive dashboard for better situational awareness and data-driven decision making, ultimately improving passenger safety and railway operations 🚄.
