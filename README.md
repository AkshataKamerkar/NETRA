# Netra - A Smart Railway Surveillance


In order to improve transportation infrastructure, this Repo describes a web application that uses artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced machine learning to monitor traffic, identify potholes, and detect accidents in real time. The system intends to make travel safer and more effective by enhancing road safety, easing traffic, and facilitating quick incident response.
## Description


The current Indian Railway CCTV Network is inadequate for effective crowd management, crime prevention, and passenger health monitoring. Existing systems fail to provide real-time alerts for suspicious activities, health incidents, and overcrowding, compromising passenger safety and operational efficiency. This creates safety and operational issues.

We propose an AI-powered web app to address this. It will use live CCTV data and pre-trained AI models to detect crime, overcrowding, suspicious objects, and health emergencies in real-time. Authorities will receive instant alerts and have an interactive dashboard for better situational awareness and data-driven decision making, ultimately improving passenger safety and railway operations.
## Key Features 


- **Improve Crowd Management :** Powered by YOLO and SORT Algorithm.
- **Prevent Crimes :** By using Three-Model Approach.

- **Monitor Passenger Health :** To improve Emergency Response.

- **Real-time Insights :** Provides Alerts and Insights on a user-friendly Dashboard.

- **Reporting :** Generate comprehensive reports on service performance and customer satisfaction.

- **User Authentication :** Secure login system for administrators, service staff, and customers.

- **Admin Panel :** Comprehensive admin panel to manage users, services, and system settings.

- **User Panel :** User-friendly interface for customers to request services, view service history, and track ongoing services.

- **Responsive Design :** Fully responsive design using Bootstrap, ensuring compatibility across devices.
